# Football Guess Who - Backend Implementation Log

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the gameplay logic and API functionality for the Football Guess Who game. Building on the architecture established in the previous phase, we're now implementing the core functionality including database repositories, API endpoints, game state management, WebSocket handlers, and the AI player.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Database Repositories**
   - Implement repository classes for each entity
   - Create data access methods using Prisma client
   - Add transaction support for atomic operations

2. **Service Layer**
   - Implement business logic for game management
   - Create authentication service
   - Build question processing logic
   - Develop footballer data service

3. **Game State Management**
   - Implement turn-based game flow
   - Create card elimination algorithm
   - Manage player sessions and reconnections
   - Track game statistics

4. **WebSocket Handlers**
   - Complete socket event handlers
   - Implement real-time game state updates
   - Add reconnection logic
   - Handle game action validation

5. **AI Player Logic**
   - Implement information entropy algorithm
   - Create difficulty level variations
   - Build question selection optimization
   - Develop guess decision making

6. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for game logic
   - Create tests for API endpoints
   - Test WebSocket functionality
   - Validate AI player decision making

## Implementation Progress

### Database Repositories

âœ… **Complete**

Implemented repository pattern for all entities:
- Created a base repository class with common operations
- Implemented specific repositories for all entities:
  - User repository for authentication and profile management
  - Footballer repository for player card data 
  - Question repository for question catalog management
  - Game repository for game room operations
  - PlayerSession repository for player state management
  - TurnRecord repository for tracking game turns
  - GameStatistic repository for game outcomes and analytics

Repository implementations include:
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Custom query methods for game-specific operations
- Transaction support for atomic updates
- Type-safe interfaces and return types
- Relations management

Game utility functions added:
- Room code generation
- Question result processing
- Information gain calculation for AI
- Guess validation

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Maintaining Type Safety with Prisma Relations
Prisma returns complex nested objects for relations, but our API needs simplified types. Creating proper mapping between database entities and response DTOs required careful type definitions.

**Solution:** Created distinct types for database entities vs. API responses, with mapping functions to convert between them. Used TypeScript's advanced type features to ensure type safety throughout the application.

### Challenge: Transaction Management
Game actions need to update multiple entities atomically to maintain data consistency.

**Solution:** Implemented transaction support in the base repository, allowing service methods to execute multiple operations within a single transaction.

### Challenge: Efficient Card Elimination
The core game mechanic of eliminating footballer cards based on question answers needed to be both efficient and flexible.

**Solution:** Created a generalized algorithm in game-utils.ts that can handle any footballer trait and expected values, making it adaptable to all question types.
