# Football Guess Who - Project Summary

## Project Overview

"Football Guess Who" is an interactive web application based on the classic "Guess Who" game concept, reimagined with football players. Players take turns asking yes/no questions to guess their opponent's secret footballer. The game supports both single-player mode against an AI opponent and real-time multiplayer mode.

## Key Features

- **Dual Game Modes:** Single-player against AI with adjustable difficulty (easy/medium/hard) and real-time multiplayer
- **Interactive Gameplay:** A 24-card grid of footballers with elimination mechanics based on question answers
- **Real-time Communication:** Socket-based architecture for instantaneous gameplay interactions
- **Responsive UI:** Adapts to desktop and mobile devices with modern, intuitive controls
- **Educational Component:** Player information cards with statistics and facts about footballers

## Technical Foundation

- **Full-Stack JavaScript:** React frontend (TypeScript) + Node.js backend
- **Real-time Architecture:** WebSocket communication using Socket.io
- **Data Persistence:** PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- **Containerized Deployment:** Docker and Docker Compose setup
- **CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Game Mechanics Summary

1. **Game Initialization:**
   - Players join a room (single or multiplayer)
   - Secret footballers are assigned
   - First player is randomly determined

2. **Core Gameplay Loop:**
   - Active player asks a yes/no question or makes a guess
   - For questions, server processes answer and eliminates cards
   - Turn alternates between players

3. **Game Resolution:**
   - Player wins by correctly guessing opponent's footballer
   - Player loses by making an incorrect guess
   - Game statistics are recorded for future analysis

## Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented in three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Architecture & Planning** (Days 1-2)
   - System design and component architecture
   - Database schema design
   - API contract definition

2. **Phase 2: Core Implementation** (Days 3-7)
   - Database and server setup
   - Core game logic implementation
   - Frontend component development
   - API integration

3. **Phase 3: Integration & Polish** (Days 8-10)
   - Full system integration
   - Real-time functionality implementation
   - UI/UX refinement
   - Testing and performance optimization

## Implementation Approach

The project follows these key implementation principles:

- **Server Authority:** Game state managed server-side to prevent cheating
- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns for maintainability
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works across devices with enhanced experiences where supported
- **Test-Driven Development:** Comprehensive test coverage for core game logic
- **Performance Optimization:** Pre-computed data structures and caching for responsive gameplay

## Quality Assurance

- **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Load Testing:** Simulated concurrent game sessions
- **Edge Case Handling:** Robust error recovery and reconnection protocols
- **Accessibility Standards:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive gameplay
