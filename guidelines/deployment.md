### 2.1 Pre-Deployment Actions

#### 2.1.1 Critical Fixes Implementation

Before deployment, the following critical issues identified in QA testing were addressed:

```javascript
// src/socket/handlers.ts
// Fixed reconnection handling with persistent session IDs
export const handleReconnection = (socket: Socket, io: Server) => {
  socket.on('reconnect_attempt', async (sessionId) => {
    try {
      // Retrieve previous session from Redis
      const previousSession = await redisClient.get(`session:${sessionId}`);
      
      if (previousSession) {
        const parsedSession = JSON.parse(previousSession);
        // Restore game state for the reconnected player
        socket.join(parsedSession.roomId);
        socket.data.sessionId = sessionId;
        
        // Notify other players of reconnection
        io.to(parsedSession.roomId).emit('player_reconnected', {
          playerId: parsedSession.playerId,
          displayName: parsedSession.displayName
        });
        
        // Update game state
        await gameService.restorePlayerSession(sessionId, socket.id);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Reconnection failed:', error);
    }
  });
};
```

```javascript
// src/services/gameService.ts
// Added event sequence numbers for state synchronization
export const processGameAction = async (action, gameState, socket, io) => {
  // Generate new sequence number
  const sequenceNumber = await redisClient.incr(`sequence:${gameState.roomId}`);
  
  // Add sequence number to action
  const actionWithSequence = {
    ...action,
    sequenceNumber
  };
  
  // Process action only if it's in sequence
  const lastProcessedSequence = await redisClient.get(`lastSequence:${gameState.roomId}`);
  
  if (!lastProcessedSequence || parseInt(lastProcessedSequence) < sequenceNumber - 1) {
    logger.warn(`Out of sequence action rejected: ${sequenceNumber}`);
    return false;
  }
  
  // Process action and update game state
  // ...processing logic...
  
  // Update last processed sequence
  await redisClient.set(`lastSequence:${gameState.roomId}`, sequenceNumber);
  
  return true;
};
```

#### 2.1.2 Database Migration

Database migrations were run to create the production schema:

```bash
# Run migrations on production database
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

#### 2.1.3 SSL Certificate Generation

SSL certificates were generated using Let's Encrypt:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d footballguesswho.example.com
```

### 2.2 Deployment Execution

The application was deployed using Docker Compose with the production configuration:

```bash
# Pull the latest images
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml pull

# Start the services
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### 2.3 Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, the following verification steps were performed:

1. Health check endpoints were monitored
2. Load testing was conducted with 50 concurrent users
3. Full game flows were tested in both single and multiplayer modes
4. Reconnection scenarios were verified
5. Security scanning was performed

## 3. Production Infrastructure 

### 3.1 Docker Services

The deployed infrastructure consists of the following Docker containers:

```
├── frontend         # Nginx serving React application
├── backend          # Node.js Express application 
├── db               # PostgreSQL database
└── redis            # Redis for caching and sessions
```

### 3.2 Network Configuration

```

### 3.3 Security Measures

1. **Network Security**
   - All internal services are on a private Docker network
   - Only Nginx is exposed to the public internet
   - Internal service communication uses Docker network DNS

2. **Application Security**
   - JWT authentication with secure token handling
   - Input validation on all endpoints
   - Rate limiting for API and socket connections
   - HTTPS with strong cipher configuration

3. **Database Security**
   - No direct access to the database from outside Docker network
   - Restricted user permissions
   - Regular automated backups

### 3.4 Monitoring Setup

Monitoring has been implemented with:

1. **Prometheus** for metrics collection
2. **Grafana** for visualization with the following dashboards:
   - System resource usage
   - Application performance
   - Game session metrics
   - Error rates

3. **Alerting** configured for:
   - High error rates (>1%)
   - Elevated response times (>500ms)
   - Server resource exhaustion (>90% CPU/memory)
   - Database connection issues

## 4. Environment Configuration

### 4.1 Production Environment Variables

The production environment is configured with these environment variables (sensitive values redacted):

```env
# .env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:${DB_PASSWORD}@db:5432/football_guess_who
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
JWT_SECRET=********
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CORS_ORIGIN=https://who.gair.com.au
LOG_LEVEL=info
DB_PASSWORD=********
```

### 4.2 Frontend Configuration

The frontend is configured with:

```env
# frontend/.env.production
VITE_API_URL=https://who.gair.com.au/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://who.gair.com.au
VITE_ENV=production
```

### 4.3 Nginx Configuration

The Nginx configuration includes optimizations for the application:

```nginx
# Optimized WebSocket timeout settings
proxy_read_timeout 300s;
proxy_send_timeout 300s;
proxy_connect_timeout 75s;

# Increased buffer size for handling larger packets
proxy_buffer_size 128k;
proxy_buffers 4 256k;
proxy_busy_buffers_size 256k;

# WebSocket specific headers
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    '' close;
}
```

## 5. Backup and Monitoring

### 5.1 Backup Strategy

Daily database backups are configured with:

```bash
# Setup cron job for daily backups
(crontab -l ; echo "0 2 * * * /opt/football-guess-who/backup-database.sh") | crontab -
```

Backups are stored both locally and in S3 with a 30-day retention policy.

### 5.2 Log Management

Centralized logging has been set up with:

1. **Log Collection**: All container logs collected via Fluentd
2. **Log Storage**: Elasticsearch
3. **Log Visualization**: Kibana with custom dashboards:
   - Error tracking dashboard
   - User activity dashboard
   - Game performance dashboard

### 5.3 Alerts and Notifications

Alerts are configured to notify the operations team via:
- Email for warning-level alerts
- SMS and Slack for critical alerts

## 6. Scaling and High Availability

### 6.1 Current Scaling Configuration

The current deployment is configured to handle approximately 500 concurrent users with:
- 1 frontend container
- 2 backend containers
- 1 database container
- 1 redis container

### 6.2 Future Scaling Recommendations

For higher load, the following scaling plan should be implemented:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Increase backend instances
   - Add load balancer for backend containers
   - Implement sticky sessions for WebSocket connections

2. **Database Scaling**
   - Add read replicas
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Consider database sharding for very high loads

## 7. Business As Usual (BAU) Operations

### 7.1 Basic Operation Commands

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Stop all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down

# Restart a specific service
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart backend

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml logs --tail=100 -f backend

# Check service status
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps

# Run database migrations
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec backend npx prisma migrate deploy

# Backup database manually
./backup-database.sh
```

### 7.2 Common Maintenance Tasks

#### 7.2.1 Deploying Updates

```bash
# Pull latest images
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml pull

# Apply update with zero downtime (for backend)
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --no-deps --scale backend=2 --no-recreate backend
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --no-deps --scale backend=1 --no-recreate backend
```

#### 7.2.2 Database Maintenance

```bash
# Connect to database CLI
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec db psql -U postgres football_guess_who

# Run database vacuum
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec db psql -U postgres -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;" football_guess_who
```

#### 7.2.3 Updating SSL Certificates

```bash
# Renew Let's Encrypt certificates
sudo certbot renew

# Reload Nginx to apply new certificates
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml exec frontend nginx -s reload
```
