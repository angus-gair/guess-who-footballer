# Football Guess Who - Security Testing Approach

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security testing approach for the Football Guess Who game. The goal is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before the application is deployed to production at who.gair.com.au.

## 2. Security Testing Objectives

- Identify vulnerabilities in the application's frontend and backend
- Verify proper implementation of security controls
- Ensure protection of game data and state
- Validate secure WebSocket communication
- Ensure the application follows security best practices
- Verify Docker container security configuration

## 3. Security Testing Scope

### In Scope

- Frontend application security
- Backend API security
- WebSocket implementation security
- Database access controls
- Docker container security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication mechanisms (if implemented)
- Network security configurations
- Session management
- Game state protection

### Out of Scope

- Host server security (infrastructure level)
- Physical security
- Social engineering attacks

   - Validate monitoring capabilities

10. **Server-Side Request Forgery**
    - Test for SSRF vulnerabilities in API endpoints
    - Verify proper URL validation

### 4.2 API Security Testing

## 5. Security Testing Tools

### 5.1 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

- **ESLint with security plugins** - For code-level security analysis
- **SonarQube** - For code quality and security scanning
- **npm audit** - For dependency vulnerability checks

### 5.2 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

- **OWASP ZAP** - For automated vulnerability scanning
- **Burp Suite** - For intercepting and modifying requests
- **Postman** - For API security testing

### 5.3 Container Security Scanning

- **Trivy** - For Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Docker Bench for Security** - For Docker configuration assessment

| High | Significant security impact, potential for data exposure | Fix within 24 hours |
| Medium | Limited security impact, requires specific conditions | Fix within 1 week |
| Low | Minimal security impact, difficult to exploit | Fix within 2 weeks |
| Info | Informational finding, best practice recommendation | Address in future sprints |

### 8.2 Vulnerability Reporting Process

1. Document vulnerability with clear reproduction steps
2. Assign severity based on impact and exploitability
3. Create ticket in bug tracking system
4. Notify development team based on severity
5. Track remediation progress
6. Verify fix implementation
7. Update security test cases if needed
