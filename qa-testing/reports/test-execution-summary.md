## 4. Detailed Bug Reports

### BUG-006: Game state recovery failing after reconnection

**Severity:** Critical  
**Priority:** P0  
**Reproducibility:** ~25% after reconnection attempts  
**Environment:** All tested browsers and devices  

**Description:**  
After a connection interruption lasting 15+ seconds, the game state fails to recover properly in approximately 25% of test scenarios. The affected player's interface becomes unresponsive, showing outdated game state.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Start a multiplayer game between two players
2. Disconnect one player's internet connection for 15+ seconds
3. Reconnect the player's internet connection
4. Observe as the game state fails to update correctly

**Expected Result:**  
Upon reconnection, the player should see the current game state and be able to continue play.

**Actual Result:**  
In ~25% of cases, the reconnected player sees an outdated game state and cannot interact properly with the game. The Socket.io client fails to re-establish the game session correctly.

**Technical Analysis:**  
Debugging reveals the `socket.on('reconnect')` handler attempts to fetch the current game state, but the server-side game session retrieval sometimes fails due to a race condition between session cleanup and reconnection logic.

### BUG-008: Server response times exceed threshold at 40+ concurrent users

**Severity:** Critical  
**Priority:** P0  
**Reproducibility:** 100% at specified concurrency  
**Environment:** All production-like environments  

**Description:**  
Server response times increase exponentially once the system reaches 40+ concurrent active games. At 75+ concurrent games, response times regularly exceed 1000ms, significantly impacting user experience.

**Technical Analysis:**  
Performance profiling reveals several inefficiencies:
1. Question evaluation logic performs redundant database queries
2. Card elimination calculations are not optimized for large datasets
3. Redis cache is not being properly utilized for game state

CPU utilization peaks at 92% during these scenarios, while memory usage grows linearly, indicating a potential memory leak.

### BUG-011: Footballer cards don't have proper alt text for screen readers

**Severity:** Critical  
**Priority:** P0  
**Reproducibility:** 100%  
**Environment:** All browsers with screen readers (tested: NVDA, VoiceOver)  

**Description:**  
Screen readers cannot properly identify footballer cards because they lack appropriate alt text. This makes the game completely unplayable for visually impaired users.

**Technical Analysis:**  
In FootballerCard.tsx component, images are rendered without proper alt attributes:

```tsx
<img src={footballer.imageUrl} className="footballer-image" />
```

Should be changed to:

```tsx
<img 
  src={footballer.imageUrl} 
  alt={`Footballer ${footballer.name}, ${footballer.position}, ${footballer.team}`} 
  className="footballer-image"
/>
```

## 5. Recommendations

Based on the test results, we recommend the following actions before production release:

### 5.1 Critical Fixes Required (P0)
- Fix socket reconnection logic to properly recover game state after disconnection
- Optimize server-side question evaluation and card elimination logic
- Add proper alt text and ARIA attributes to all game components
- Fix Safari-specific WebSocket reconnection issues
- Implement proper turn validation to prevent out-of-turn actions

### 5.2 High Priority Improvements (P1)
- Improve mobile UI for screens smaller than 5.5"
- Fix color contrast issues on question buttons
- Optimize performance for 75+ concurrent users
- Implement comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Add keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements

### 5.3 Medium Priority Improvements (P2)
- Enhance logging for better debugging
- Improve error messages for users
- Implement automated accessibility testing in CI pipeline
- Add visual indicators for network status
- Optimize asset loading for slow connections

## 6. Test Environment Information

- **Frontend:** React 18.2.0, Vite 4.3.2
- **Backend:** Node.js 18.15.0, Express 4.18.2
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 14.7
- **Infrastructure:** Docker containers on AWS ECS
- **Testing Tools:** Jest, Cypress, k6, axe-core, WebPageTest
- **Browsers:** Chrome 114, Firefox 115, Safari 16.5, Edge 114
- **Devices:** iPhone 13, Samsung S21, iPad Pro, Desktop (Windows/Mac)

## 7. Conclusion

While the Football Guess Who game demonstrates strong core functionality with an 80.6% overall pass rate, the 27 failed tests include several critical issues that must be addressed before production deployment. Most critical issues relate to connection resilience, performance at scale, and accessibility concerns.

We recommend completing the P0 fixes before proceeding with beta testing, which should raise the pass rate to approximately 90%. The P1 and P2 improvements can be addressed in parallel with beta testing to ensure a high-quality production release.
